ReactChat is a project to build chat application using React and Firebase. This project is for my personal education to understand better about web development.

This project is hugely inspired by "Lama Dev" who basically walked me through every aspects of this project to help me understand webdevelopment better.

Current feature to this is App is Login/ Register/ Chatting/ Sending message.

What I think could be improved are
  1) Blocking feature : I was determined in doing it but after many failings I decided to drop it for now since I can't really wrap my mind around it
  2) Better UI
  3) Performance : I sense that the app is quite slow so it would be hugely upgrade if I can fix it

Overall this project taught me so much about React and how to communicate between platforms as well as how to implement Firebase to your application.
